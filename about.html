<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Mark Ian Verdan, currently working as a Learning Specialist in Telus International and I would like 
  to learn how to create my own website.</p>

<p>During my free time, I like wathcing Netflix, playing Rubiks Cube, playing video games, and sleeping. If I have
  extra time and money, I also buy Bicycle Playing Cards and collect those as well.</p>
